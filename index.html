    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am V. Sneha Madhuri, a second-year B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Seshadri Rao Gudlavalleru Engineering College. I have a strong interest in AI, web development, and building innovative tech solutions that address real-world problems.

I have participated in multiple team-based projects and hackathons, where I gained practical experience in machine learning, Python programming, and full stack development using modern technologies like React, Flask, and Node.js. I am a quick learner, dedicated team player, and always eager to take on new challenges to expand my skill set and contribute meaningfully to the tech community.</p>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Cyberbullying Detection</h3>
      <p>Built an AI-powered web application that detects cyberbullying in online text using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Used text classification techniques and trained models to identify harmful, offensive, or abusive content in real-time.
Implemented with Python, Flask, and NLP libraries like NLTK and Scikit-learn to analyze and flag toxic behavior.
The project promotes safe online communication and demonstrates skills in ethical AI, backend development, and NLP.
